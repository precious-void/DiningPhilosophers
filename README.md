# DiningPhilosophers
Dining philosophers problem solved with Python threadings` library. 
Used Mutexes (Locks) and priority of forks

There`re several settings: 
* *timeout* (time before game is stopped)
* *numPhil* (number of Philosophs)
* *debug* (on/off debug prints)

~~~~python 
timeout = 100
numPhil = 5 
debug = False
~~~~

In output you`ll get list of entrances of each philosoph.
